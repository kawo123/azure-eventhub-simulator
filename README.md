# Azure Event Hub Simulator

Python utility for simulating events to Azure Event Hub using predefined dataset.

## Pre-requisite

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Anaconda with Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository

- In `./terraform`:
  - Change `prefix` in `variables.tf` because Azure Event Hubs Namespace name has to be globally unique
    - For the remainder of the documentation, the prefix `azure-eh` **WILL BE ASSUMED**
  - Run `terraform init`
  - Run `terraform plan -out=out.tfplan`
  - Run `terraform apply out.tfplan`
  - Note the outputs of `terraform apply`

- In `./`:
  - Install python dependencies from `./requirements.txt`
  - Run `event_hub_simulator.py`
    - Use `--help` flag for more information on how to run this utility if needed

```bash
python eventhub_simulator.py \
  --conn-str <event-hub-connection-string> \
  --data-path <csv-file-path>
```

- Feel free to use sample data `"./data/productclickstream.csv"` as `<csv-file-path>` in the above sample
